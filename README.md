# Leekstra - World Marketplace For Event Hosts & Planners

## Introduction
Using the term marketplace to describe `leekstra` is odd because, all it does is match you or say connect you with the best planner for the event you are trying to host. That is if you are the `host`.

As for the `planner`, you get the best offers for jobs based on what you're comfortable doing and maybe ones we have considered based on your location. Especially if you are `strict on location`.

## Installation
This is a web application, you only need navigate to this [link](https://www.leekstra.vercel.app) on your browser and register as either `host` or `planner`.

## Usuage
After registration, your profile will be the first to hit your screen. Which you can edit to your desired form. 

As for finding match for your desired event (party or ceremony of any sort), navigate to the `find-match` link on your main nav on the top of the screen. On the filter form on the right section on the page. Customize the filter to meet the exact kind of event you intend to create.

Hit the `FIND MATCH` button, wait a while and you should be seeing the list containing the best matches for the event you just described.

Now you can send the planners a `job invite` and once they accept, you can contact, interview and probably even end up recruiting them for the job. And yes!, you can invite more than one planners.

Also, instead of hitting the `FIND MATCH` button in the above step, you can hit the `PUBLISH` button instead. This will enlist your event invite to every match found in the system and have them apply themselves. Thereby saving you all the stress of inviting everyone of them at a time. This method is comes very handy when you wish to interview or go through a vast margin of planners.

Disclaimer: We do not handle any payment exchange between host and planner yet. Our sole responsibility is linking the best host(s) and best planner(s) to lead to a great event.
